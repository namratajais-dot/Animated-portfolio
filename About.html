        I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer with a passion for building
        impactful, user-centric digital experiences. While mastering the full
        development stack, I'm also exploring Artificial Intelligence and
        Machine Learning to create smarter, more responsive applications. <br/> I'm
        especially drawn to designing visually creative and interactive websites
        that not only function beautifully but also tell a story. <br/>
